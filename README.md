# About 

The purpose of this package is to provide some utilities to read and transpile a ONNX encoded model into a something compatible with [Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia/gorgonia)

It relies on the [ONNX Go](https://github.com/owulveryck/onnx-go) package

# Blog

I wrote two article about the genesis of the project:

* [My journey with ONNX and Go - The beginning](https://blog.owulveryck.info/2018/08/14/my-journey-with-onnx-and-go---the-beginning.html)
* [My journey with ONNX and Go - Running the graph](https://blog.owulveryck.info/2018/09/19/my-journey-with-onnx-and-go---running-the-graph.html)
